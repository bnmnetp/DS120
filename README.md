### September 21

* Topics
  * Questions about the election data  --   Do the FIRST TWO
    * If Hillary Clinton gets 90% of the Sanders votes and  30 % of all of the non-trump republican votes while trump captures 10% of the Sanders vote along with the 70% of the rest of the republicans who would win the popular vote?
    * What is the name of the top vote getter for each state?
	  * Compare the percentage of votes for donald trump in the counties where that are more than 50% black or african american
	  * Who won the vote in the counties where over 30% of the population is older than 65 ?
    * Using the Electoral college spreadsheet - who would win the electoral college if the votes were winner take all?
    * Who would win if the votes were proportionally allocated?

* Assignment for Friday
  * Pick one of the scenarios from last week, and research a real world example of a similar case.  Try to make a case for the opposite point of view for which you voted last Friday.   Write a short paper of about 1000 words to summarize the real world incident and to make your case.

### September 19

* Topics
  * A different example of using the Optimizer (in Google Sheets)
  * Getting to know the county data
  * What kinds of questions can we ask?


* Assignment for Wednesday
  * Starting with the ``election_results`` spreadsheet, answer the question, who won more counties, Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump?  You can do this by creating a cell for each of them that shows the number of counties in which one had more votes than the other.  -- This might not mean much until we figure out a more sophisticated analysis, but its good practice.   Turn in your spreadsheet on katie before class on Wednesday.


### September 16

### September 14

* Topics
    * Patterns of data processing - grouping and aggregating

    * Using the Solver

* Assignment for Wednesday
    * Download the Concessions workbook
    * Find the Calories-Solver tab.  You will also need to enable the solver extension as described in the book.  Modify the sheet so that it has the following constraints and goals:  We want to find the minimum priced meal with 2400 calories that includes  at least one beverage, at least one main meal item, and at least one desert item.  
    * You can upload your finished workbook to Katie.

### September 7

* Topics
   * Review match/index
   * vlookup
   * sumif
   * countif

   * Which meal has the most calories?
   * Average calories per day?
   * Meal with the lowest fat?
   * Making data entry better using vlookup

* Assignment for Friday

   * Readings and reading response.

### September 5

* Topics
    * We will work on developing some summary information on the Calorie Spreadsheet.
    * Key Excel Functions from today:
       * sum
       * average
       * max
       * match
       * index
       * sumif
       * countif

    * If time permits we'll download and look at the election data.

* Assignment
   * For Wednesday develop a simple expense tracking spreadsheet with the following columns
      * date
      * purchaser (name of the person that bought the item)
      * category (grocery, toiletry, lawn&garden, etc)
      * item
      * cost
      * store (where you purchased it)

      * Add 15 - 20 rows of data and then create a summary of the total cost and average cost of all items.  Use the SUMIF function to calculate The total for each category, and the  SUMIF and COUNTIF functions to calculate the average for items purchased in a particular store.

    * For Wednesday, read chapter 1 in Data Smart


### September 2

* Topics
    * discussion of the readings
    * Starting in on Excel

* Assignment
    * Create a spreadsheet for the weekend of nutritional data from what you eat.  (or a made-up diet, I don't need to know what you ate)  The columns in the spreadsheet should be:
      * Meal
      * Food
      * calories
      * protein
      * carbs
      * fat

    I understand the Caf has nutritional data posted for the meals or you can use the USDA website or another app that has nutrition data about common foods.  the point is to make a spreadsheet with "a bunch" of rows in it.
