* Write 500 word response on Katie, and write two questions for class discussion.

**For Monday**
* Find a dataset that will be appropriate for you try your hand at clustering.   You will turn in a summary of the dataset, the variables it contains, and why you think it is a good dataset for the K-means clustering algorithm.  Remember the limitations of Excel!   Solver can only manage 200 variables, so your number of variables * the number of clusters must be less than 200.  By Monday March 13, you will need to turn in An Excel spreadsheet with your completed clustering, showing your centroids, and an analysis of how accurately you were able to classify your training and test sets.  If your data set does not contain predetermined labels then you should provide an analysis of what you think your clusters represent.

Here are two good sources for data sets to get you started:

* Readings For Friday
  * The following readings bring up some interesting issues regarding the use of Big Data in the courtroom.  Sometimes there are unintended consequences when we willingly giving up information that seems harmless.
  * [When Fitbit is the Expert witness](http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/11/when-fitbit-is-the-expert-witness/382936/)
  * [Divorced by Data](https://backchannel.com/divorced-by-data-894b6221b2c1#.twi4yw6dj)


### Feb 6

* Topics
    * We will work on developing some summary information on the Nutrition Spreadsheet
    * Key Excel Functions from today:
       * sum
       * average
       * max
       * match
       * index
       * sumif
       * countif


* Assignment
   * For Wednesday develop a simple expense tracking spreadsheet with the following columns
      * date
      * purchaser (name of the person that bought the item)
      * category (grocery, toiletry, lawn&garden, etc)
      * item
      * cost
      * store (where you purchased it)

      * Add 15 - 20 rows of data and then create a summary of the total cost and average cost of all items.  Use the SUMIF function to calculate The total for each category, and the  SUMIF and COUNTIF functions to calculate the average for items purchased in a particular store.

    * For Wednesday, read chapter 1 in Data Smart

### Feb 3

* Topics
    * Discussion of the readings
    * Find an interesting "data story" -- What kind of story is it (see the 10 kinds of stories article)
    * Analyze the "data story" carefully - does it meet the criteria for objectivity? honesty?

    * Starting in on Excel

* Assignment
    * Create a spreadsheet for the weekend of nutritional data from what you eat.  (or a made-up diet, I don't need to know what you ate)  The columns in the spreadsheet should be:
      * Meal
      * Food
      * calories
      * protein
      * carbs
      * fat

    I understand the Caf has nutritional data posted for the meals or you can use the USDA website or another app that has nutrition data about common foods.  the point is to make a spreadsheet with "a bunch" of rows in it.


### Feb 1 - Welcome

* Topics
  * What is Data Science?
  * Course Administrivia
  * What do you know about Excel?
